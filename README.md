# Neighbourapp Backend

This backend runs on Ruby on Rails.
Clone and start the server.
A redis and pq server is required.

This has been created for a school project where the main purpose was to create a platform that would help people find other people to do stuff.

I haven't touched it for a while so I don't think I'm ever going to update any of this.
It's kinda staying here like a memory
